  Record's `...` spread is not supported in pattern matches.
Explanation: you can't collect a subset of a record's field into its own record, since a record needs an explicit declaration and that subset wouldn't have one.
Solution: you need to pull out each field you want explicitly.

;;match x with | { a; b = { x; y } } -> () | { x; y } -> () | { a; b } -> ()
