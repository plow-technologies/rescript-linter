Special tests for super errors (the pretty error display).

Follow CONTRIBUTING.md and build the project, then run `node ./jscomp/build_tests/super_errors/input.js` at the root of the project to check the tests against previous snapshots.

Run `node ./jscomp/build_tests/super_errors/input.js update` to update the snapshots (assuming you've made some changes to super errors' display and/or messages).
