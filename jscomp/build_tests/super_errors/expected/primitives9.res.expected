  [36m/.../fixtures/primitives9.res[0m:[2m1:14-20[0m

  [1;31m1[0m [2mâ”‚[0m let a: int = [1;31m"hello"[0m
  2 [2mâ”‚[0m 

  This has type: [1;31mstring[0m
  But it's expected to have type: [1;33mint[0m
  
  You can convert [1;33mstring[0m to [1;33mint[0m with [1;33mBelt.Int.fromString[0m.
