  [36m/.../fixtures/switch_different_types.res[0m:[2m7:10-23[0m

  5 [2mâ”‚[0m   switch foo {
  6 [2mâ”‚[0m   | "world" => ()
  [1;31m7[0m [2mâ”‚[0m   | _ => [1;31msomeFunction()[0m
  8 [2mâ”‚[0m   }
  9 [2mâ”‚[0m }

  This has type: [1;31mstring[0m
  But this switch is expected to return: [1;33munit[0m

  All branches in a [1;33mswitch[0m must return the same type. To fix this, change your branch to return the expected type.
