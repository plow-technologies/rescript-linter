  [1;31m1[0m [2mâ”‚[0m let x = [1, 2, [1;31m"hello"[0m]
  2 [2mâ”‚[0m 

  This array item has type: [1;31mstring[0m
  But this array is expected to have items of type: [1;33mint[0m

  Arrays can only contain items of the same type.

  Possible solutions:
  - Convert all values in the array to the same type.
  - Use a tuple, if your array is of fixed length. Tuples can mix types freely, and compiles to a JavaScript array. Example of a tuple: `let myTuple = (10, "hello", 15.5, true)
  
  You can convert [1;33mstring[0m to [1;33mint[0m with [1;33mBelt.Int.fromString[0m.
