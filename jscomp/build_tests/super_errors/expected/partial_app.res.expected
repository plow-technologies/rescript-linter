  This function call is at the top level and is expected to return `unit`. But it's returning `int => int`.

  In ReScript, anything at the top level must evaluate to `unit`. You can fix this by assigning the expression to a value, or piping it into the `ignore` function.

  Possible solutions:
  - Assigning to a value that is then ignored: `let _ = yourFunctionCall()`
  - Piping into the built-in ignore function to ignore the result: `yourFunctionCall()->ignore`
