  This is at the top level and is expected to return `unit`. But it's returning `int`.

  In ReScript, anything at the top level must evaluate to `unit`. You can fix this by assigning the expression to a value, or piping it into the `ignore` function.

  Possible solutions:
  - Assigning to a value that is then ignored: `let _ = yourExpression`
  - Piping into the built-in ignore function to ignore the result: `yourExpression->ignore`
