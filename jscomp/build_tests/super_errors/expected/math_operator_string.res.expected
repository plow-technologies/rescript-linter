  [36m/.../fixtures/math_operator_string.res[0m:[2m1:9-15[0m

  [1;31m1[0m [2mâ”‚[0m let x = [1;31m"hello"[0m + "what"
  2 [2mâ”‚[0m 

  This has type: [1;31mstring[0m
  But it's being used with the [1;33m+[0m operator, which works on: [1;33mint[0m

  Are you looking to concatenate strings? Use the operator [1;33m++[0m, which concatenates strings.

  Possible solutions:
  - Change the [1;33m+[0m operator to [1;33m++[0m to concatenate strings instead.
  
  You can convert [1;33mstring[0m to [1;33mint[0m with [1;33mBelt.Int.fromString[0m.
