If value is not found and value is less than one or more elements in array,

If value is not found and value is greater than all elements in array,
the negative number returned is the bitwise complement of

for example, if `key` is smaller than all elements return `-1` since `lnot (-1) = 0`
if `key` is larger than all elements return `- (len + 1)` since `lnot (-(len+1)) = len`
