/* OCaml currently does not allow the components of a sum type to be
   mutable. Yet, for optimal space efficiency, we must have cons cells
   whose [next] field is mutable. This leads us to define a type of
   cyclic lists, so as to eliminate the [Nil] case and the sum
   type. */

/* A queue is a reference to either nothing or some cell of a cyclic
   list. By convention, that cell is to be viewed as the last cell in
   the queue. The first cell in the queue is then found in constant
   time: it is the next cell in the cyclic list. The queue's length is
   also recorded, so as to make [length] a constant-time operation.

   The [tail] field should really be of type ['a cell option], but
   then it would be [None] when [length] is 0 and [Some] otherwise,
   leading to redundant memory allocation and accesses. We avoid this
   overhead by filling [tail] with a dummy value when [length] is 0.
   Of course, this requires bending the type system's arm slightly,
   because it does not have dependent sums. */
